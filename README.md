For this project, I made and designed an interactive webpage which shows someone's belly button data. You can change the person you want to look at by changing the "Test Subject ID No." on the left side of the webpage and see the changes on the charts at the right.

The interactive visualizations I made was a horizontal bar chart, a gauge chart, and a bubble chart. For each visualization, you can hover over the chart to view the data. I read the data using D3 while CSS was used to design this webpage.
